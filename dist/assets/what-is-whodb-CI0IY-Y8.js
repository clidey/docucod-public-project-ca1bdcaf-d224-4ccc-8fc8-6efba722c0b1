## What Exactly is WhoDB?

At its core, WhoDB is a database management system designed to simplify how you interact with your data across numerous databases. It exposes an elegant, unified interface that abstracts away the technical clutter, so you focus on outcomes rather than setup or syntax.

### The Problem It Solves

Across projects and organizations, teams struggle juggling multiple database tools—each with different UIs, query languages, and performance bottlenecks. For instance, a developer might switch between a MongoDB UI and a relational database panel regularly, losing context and efficiency.

WhoDB solves this by unifying those interactions under a single, coherent platform that supports diverse database types and lets you talk to your data conversationally. This eliminates context switching, reduces setup time, and accelerates exploration and management.

### Unique Advantages

- **Conversational AI Integration**: Embedded AI lets you write queries and commands in plain English and receive instant data responses or suggestions.
- **Broad Plugin Architecture**: Supports a vast range of databases from SQL to NoSQL and cloud-hosted databases, ensuring your existing stack just works.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: The entire application is under 50MB, making it quick to install and operate without heavy system resource consumption.
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Visual schema graphs, inline editing, and scratchpad queries give you multiple angles of working with your data.

### How WhoDB Works at a High Level

WhoDB runs as a server on your local machine or deployment environment, embedding a powerful GoLang backend engine with plugins for each supported database type. Its frontend interfaces through your browser, providing a single-pane UI.

Integrated AI models can be locally deployed (e.g., Ollama) or connected via API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), enabling natural language interactions seamlessly coupled with traditional query editing.

## Core Features & Capabilities

- **Multi-Database Plugin Support**: Native plugins for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite3, MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB, ElasticSearch, ClickHouse, and more, ensuring comprehensive compatibility.

- **Conversational AI Querying**: Use ChatGPT, Ollama, or Anthropic-powered models directly within the UI to generate queries, receive explanations, or perform complex data interactions in plain language.

- **Schema Visualization**: Interactive graphs reveal tables, collections, indexes, and relationships, making it easier to understand and navigate complex databases.

- **Scratchpad and Raw Query Executor**: A notebook-like environment for experimenting with queries, saving drafts, and mixing AI assistance with manual SQL or NoSQL commands.

- **Inline Editing and Data Preview**: Edit records or documents directly in tables or forms with immediate visual feedback.

- **Multi-Edition Support**:
  - Community Edition (CE): Open-source, supports core databases with essential features.
  - Enterprise Edition (EE): Adds support for specialized databases and advanced capabilities.

- **Fast and Responsive UI**: Virtualized tables and efficient data fetching keep the interface responsive even with large datasets.

### Example Use Case

Consider a developer managing a PostgreSQL and MongoDB instance. Instead of juggling separate tools, they open WhoDB, connect both databases via plugins, explore schemas graphically, and execute natural language queries like "Show me the top 10 customers by revenue last quarter". The AI translates this into SQL and MongoDB queries seamlessly, returning results instantly without manual query crafting.
