# Prerequisites & System Requirements

This page outlines the essential platforms, hardware, software dependencies, and environment settings required to prepare your system for installing and running WhoDB. Whether you're a local developer building from source or deploying WhoDB in production, these guidelines ensure a smooth setup and optimal performance.

---

## 1. Supported Platforms

WhoDB is designed to be platform-agnostic with official support for the following operating systems:

- **Linux** (x86_64 and ARM64 architectures)
- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon processors)
- **Windows 10/11** (via WSL 2 recommended for full compatibility)

> For the best experience, especially in production, Linux servers are recommended.

## 2. Minimum Hardware Requirements

| Component     | Minimum Specification           | Recommended Specification     |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| CPU           | 2 cores                        | 4+ cores                      |
| Memory (RAM)  | 4 GB                          | 8 GB or more                  |
| Disk Space    | 2 GB free                    | 10 GB+ (to accommodate logs, data caching, and frontend assets) |
| Network       | Stable internet connection (for AI integrations and dependency fetching) | Gigabit connectivity for multi-user setups |

> Note: Hardware requirements will increase depending on the size of your databases and usage patterns.

## 3. Software Dependencies

Before installing or building WhoDB, ensure the following software is installed and accessible from your command line:

- **Go (golang)**
  - Version: 1.24 or higher
  - Purpose: Compiling the Go backend and Enterprise Edition modules
  - Official download: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)

- **Node.js**
  - Version: 18.x LTS or newer
  - Purpose: Building the React frontend
  - Official download: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

- **pnpm (Performant package manager)**
  - Version: Latest stable
  - Purpose: Efficiently managing frontend dependencies
  - Install via npm: \`npm install -g pnpm\`

- **Docker (optional but recommended for production)**
  - Version: 20.10 or higher
  - Purpose: Containerized deployment and environment consistency
  - Official download: [https://www.docker.com/get-started/](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

> <Note>
> Without these dependencies installed, building or running WhoDB will fail.
> Use the installation instructions in the [Installation Methods](../setup-requirements/installation-methods) guide for detailed steps.
> </Note>

## 4. Runtime Environment Requirements

- **Ports**
  - Ensure the following ports are open and not blocked by firewalls:
    - Default Web UI port: \`8080\`
    - API and backend communication as configured

- **Permissions**
  - User running WhoDB should have read/write access to the installation directories and config files.
  - For Enterprise Edition deployments, verify additional permissions for plugin execution.

- **Environment Variables**
  - Basic environment variables such as \`PATH\` must include Go, Node.js, and pnpm binaries.
  - See [Environment Variables & Third-Party Integrations](../../deployment/prod_deployment/env_config) for production tuning.

## 5. Special Notes for Enterprise Edition (EE)

The Enterprise Edition includes extended features and requires additional setup:

- Access to Enterprise Edition modules (\`ee/\` directory) is mandatory before building or running EE.
- EE validation script (\`scripts/validate-ee.sh\`) must succeed to confirm module presence and correct tooling.
- Build tooling (Go, pnpm, Node.js) versions must align with those needed for CE.

<Callout>
Ensure you have appropriate access permissions to obtain the EE modules. See the Enterprise Edition README for more details: https://github.com/clidey/whodb/blob/main/ee/README.md
</Callout>

## 6. Natural Language Integration Dependencies

WhoDB supports conversational AI capabilities that rely on external LLM providers.

- **Supported AI providers:**
  - Ollama
  - Anthropic
  - OpenAI

- **Connectivity**
  - Outbound HTTPS access on ports 443 for API calls to AI providers

- **API credentials**
  - Required for Anthropic and OpenAI; configure these securely in your environment.

- **Container and Deployment notes**
  - When deploying in containers, ensure environment variables for API keys are set and network outbound rules permit AI API calls.

- **Version notes**
  - Keep your WhoDB version and AI integration libraries up-to-date for compatibility.

## 7. Summary Checklist Before Installation

<Check>
 - Confirm your OS matches supported platforms
 - Verify hardware meets minimum specs
 - Install Go 1.24+, Node.js 18+, and pnpm
 - (Optional) Install Docker for containerized setup
 - Open port 8080 and other relevant ports
 - Ensure EE modules are available for Enterprise Edition
 - Prepare API keys and network access for AI integrations
</Check>

## Troubleshooting Common Prerequisite Issues

<AccordionGroup title="Troubleshooting Known Setup Issues">
<Accordion title="Go Not Found or Incorrect Version">
If the \`go\` command is not found or the version is below 1.24:

- Verify Go is installed with \`go version\`
- Download and install the latest version from https://golang.org/dl/
- Ensure Goâ€™s bin directory is added to your PATH environment variable
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="pnpm Missing or Not Installed">
To check if pnpm is available, run \`pnpm --version\`.

If not installed:

\`\`\`bash
npm install -g pnpm
\`\`\`

Confirm installation by running \`pnpm --version\`.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Node.js Version Issues">
WhoDB requires Node.js 18 or later.

- Check your version: \`node --version\`
- Update Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- Use version managers like nvm for easier upgrades if needed
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Enterprise Edition Modules Missing">
During EE build or validation, you may see errors about missing \`ee/\` directory.

- Confirm you have access to the Enterprise Edition source
- Place the \`ee\` directory under the project root
- Run \`$ ./scripts/validate-ee.sh\` to verify
- For missing or empty directories, re-check your EE source
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Network Access Blocked for AI Integrations">
If AI features are not working:

- Verify firewall allows outbound HTTPS (port 443)
- Check API keys are correctly set
- Confirm your container or cloud environment allows external API calls
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
