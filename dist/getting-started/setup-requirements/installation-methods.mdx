# Installation Methods

This guide provides detailed, step-by-step instructions to install and run WhoDB using different setups tailored to your environment. Whether you prefer a fast Docker-based deployment or a manual installation and build from source for the frontend and backend components, this page will guide you through each method. You will also learn about critical environment variables and how to select the appropriate edition.

---

## 1. Preparation and Requirements

Before starting installation, ensure your system meets the following:

- **Supported Operating Systems:** Linux, macOS, and Windows (with WSL 2 recommended for Windows).
- **Essential Software:** 
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (if using Docker setup)
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (for multi-container setups)
  - [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.19 or later) for backend manual builds
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (version 18+), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) for frontend builds
- **System Resources:** Minimum 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space

<Tip>
If you plan to run WhoDB in production, consider reviewing "Choosing Community vs. Enterprise Edition" to pick the edition that matches your needs.
</Tip>

## 2. Quick Setup Using Docker and Docker Compose

Docker setup provides the fastest path to get WhoDB running locally or in a containerized environment. This method launches both frontend and backend components with recommended defaults.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clidey/whodb.git
cd whodb
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Edition

By default, the Docker Compose will run the Community Edition.
To use Enterprise Edition, set the environment variable `WHODB_EDITION=enterprise` in the compose override or `.env` file.

### Step 3: Start WhoDB with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

You should see both backend and frontend containers starting.

### Step 4: Verify Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

Look for containers named `whodb-backend` and `whodb-frontend` in the list.

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the WhoDB web UI.

<Check>
If the UI does not load, check container logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs whodb-backend
```

Look for errors related to port conflicts or missing environment variables.
</Check>

## 3. Manual Installation and Build From Source

For developers or those wanting full control, building from source allows customization and debugging.

### Backend Installation

#### Step 1: Install Go

Ensure Go 1.19+ is installed and your `GOPATH` and `PATH` are correctly set.

Verify by:

```bash
go version
```

#### Step 2: Build Backend

From the root directory:

```bash
cd backend
go build -o whodb-server ./cmd/server
```

This generates a binary `whodb-server` in the current folder.

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or export variables directly.

Key environment variables:

- `WHODB_EDITION`: `community` or `enterprise` (default: `community`)
- `WHODB_BACKEND_PORT`: Port for backend server (default: `8080`)
- `WHODB_DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string

Example `.env` file:

```env
WHODB_EDITION=community
WHODB_BACKEND_PORT=8080
WHODB_DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/whodb
```

#### Step 4: Run Backend Server

Start the backend:

```bash
./whodb-server
```

The service listens on the configured port.

---

### Frontend Installation

#### Step 1: Install Node.js and pnpm

Verify Node.js 18+ and install pnpm globally:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

#### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend source directory:

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
```

#### Step 3: Configure Frontend

Edit or create a `.env` file to set API endpoint for backend, e.g.: 

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

#### Step 4: Start Frontend Development Server

Run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will launch the frontend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

<Tip>
Use this mode for active development with hot reload.
</Tip>

## 4. Setting Up Your Database

WhoDB supports various databases including Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, MongoDB, and ClickHouse.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Database

Create and configure your database instance. Use the provided sample data scripts (e.g., under `dev/sample-data`) to initialize schemas and sample records.
- For SQL databases, run the corresponding SQL script.
- For MongoDB, run the provided `.js` initialization script.

### Step 2: Configure Connection

Set `WHODB_DATABASE_URL` with the correct connection string format matching your DB:

- Postgres: `postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- MySQL/MariaDB: `mysql://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- SQLite3: `file:path/to/database.sqlite` (local file path)
- MongoDB: `mongodb://user:pass@host:port/dbname`
- ClickHouse: `clickhouse://user:pass@host:port/dbname`

## 5. Key Configuration Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                                    | Default         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `WHODB_EDITION`     | Edition selection: `community` or `enterprise` | `community`     |
| `WHODB_BACKEND_PORT`| Port for backend listening                      | `8080`          |
| `WHODB_DATABASE_URL`| Database connection string                       | *Required*      |
| `WHODB_LOG_LEVEL`   | Log verbosity: `info`, `debug`, `error`         | `info`          |

<Warning>
Always secure your database credentials and avoid committing `.env` files containing secrets.
</Warning>

---

## 6. Verification and First Run

After installation and configuration:

1. Start backend server or Docker containers.
2. Launch frontend UI.
3. Navigate to the UI in your browser.
4. Connect to your database using the UI following the next guide, "Connecting to Your Database." 

If the UI loads and allows database connection setup, your installation succeeded.
